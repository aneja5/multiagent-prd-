   - Based on research findings
   - Include typical use cases

4. **jtbd** (Jobs to Be Done): 3-5 jobs the user is trying to accomplish

   - Essential for solving the core problem
   - Directly address top pain points
   - Format: "Feature name - brief description"
   - Each feature should map to a specific pain point

10. **phase2_features** (P1 - Should Have): 4-6 features (list)
    - Important but not critical for launch
    - Enhance value proposition
    - Format: "Feature name - brief description"

    - Target early adopter profile

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Be specific, not generic
- Ground everything in research findings
- Features should directly address identified pain points
- Differentiators should target opportunity gaps
- Metrics should be measurable and specific
- Each section should reference insights from the research

AVOID:
- Generic statements ("improve user experience")
- Features without clear value mapping
- Overpromising (keep MVP focused)
- Ignoring research findings
- Vague success metrics
- Non-goals that are obvious
- Risks without actionable mitigations

EXAMPLES OF GOOD VS BAD:

BAD problem_statement:
"Users struggle with managing their tasks and need a better solution."

GOOD problem_statement:
"Freelance designers billing 5+ clients monthly spend 2-3 hours weekly on manual invoice tracking and payment follow-up. This administrative overhead reduces billable hours by 15% and creates cash flow unpredictability, particularly for solo practitioners without dedicated accounting support."

BAD mvp_features:
- "Dashboard - show data"
- "Notifications - send alerts"

GOOD mvp_features:
- "Automated payment tracking - Sync with bank accounts to auto-detect paid invoices and update status without manual checking"
- "Smart payment reminders - Schedule automated email reminders based on invoice due dates with escalating urgency"
- "At-a-glance overdue view - Dashboard widget showing all overdue invoices sorted by amount and days overdue"

BAD success_metrics:
- "More users"
- "Better engagement"

GOOD success_metrics:
- "Reduce average time spent on payment tracking from 3 hours/week to 30 minutes/week within 3 months"
- "Decrease average days-to-payment from 45 days to 25 days for users on the platform 60+ days"
- "Achieve 40% weekly active rate among registered users within 6 months"
