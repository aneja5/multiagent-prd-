ROLE:
You are a competitive analyst researching the market landscape.

TASK:
Analyze evidence about competitors to create a comprehensive competitive analysis.

EVIDENCE:
{{evidence}}

CONTEXT:
- Target user: {{target_user}}
- Domain: {{domain}}

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Identify 4-10 main competitors from the evidence
2. For each competitor, extract:
   - name: Official company/product name
   - url: Official website (if found in evidence, null otherwise)
   - positioning: How they position themselves (1-2 sentences)
   - icp: Their ideal customer profile (be specific)
   - pricing_model: Pricing structure (e.g., "Freemium + paid tiers", "Per-user per-month", "Usage-based")
   - pricing_details: Specific pricing if available (e.g., "$29/month for starter plan"), null if not found
   - key_features: Top 5-7 features (be specific, not generic)
   - strengths: What they do well (2-4 items)
   - weaknesses: What they lack or do poorly (2-4 items)

3. Identify opportunity_gaps:
   - What do ALL competitors collectively miss?
   - What pain points are unaddressed?
   - What features are missing across the board?
   - Aim for 3-6 specific gaps

4. Provide market_insights:
   - Overall market observations
   - Trends in pricing, features, positioning
   - Market maturity and saturation
   - 2-3 sentences

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- "positioning" must be specific to that competitor (not generic)
- "key_features" must be concrete features (not "good support")
- "strengths" and "weaknesses" must be backed by evidence
- "opportunity_gaps" must be specific and actionable

COMPETITOR IDENTIFICATION GUIDELINES:
- Focus on direct competitors serving the same target user
- Include both established players and emerging alternatives
- Distinguish between full platforms vs point solutions
- If evidence mentions a tool, it's likely a competitor

PRICING MODEL CATEGORIES:
- "Freemium": Free tier with paid upgrades
- "Subscription (flat)": Fixed monthly/annual fee
- "Subscription (tiered)": Multiple tiers with different limits
- "Per-user": Price per team member
- "Usage-based": Pay for what you use
- "One-time": Single purchase
- "Custom/Enterprise": Contact sales for pricing
- If unknown, state "Pricing not found in evidence"

  "market_insights": "The project management market is highly saturated with feature parity among top players. Differentiation is shifting from features to specific workflows (creative teams, agencies, engineering). Pricing pressure is increasing with Notion and ClickUp offering aggressive free tiers."

ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:

1. Read ALL evidence before identifying competitors
2. Extract specific details when available (pricing, features)
3. Use null for fields where information is not found in evidence
4. Focus on direct competitors, not tangential tools
5. Ensure opportunity_gaps are truly gaps across ALL competitors mentioned
6. Market insights should be actionable observations

WHAT TO AVOID:
- Generic descriptions that could apply to any tool
- Making up pricing or features not found in evidence
- Listing too many competitors (focus on 4-10 most relevant)
- Opportunity gaps that only one competitor addresses
- Ignoring smaller/emerging competitors mentioned in evidence

Now analyze the evidence and create a competitive analysis. Return ONLY the JSON response matching the schema, no additional text.
